<h1>RAG application over NCERT books</h1>

We build a RAG application for performing question answering over NCERT books of class 11 and 12. At the moment the repository implements  a naive RAG which can be found in the `naive_rag.ipynb`  notebook. But we intend to incrementally improve the  performence by adding advanced RAG features like Chain-Of-Thought and HyDe. 


We will  optimize each component of the RAG pipeline i.e  document parsers,  chunking, indexing, search & retrieval and the generation component individually. We will try to establish evaluation strategies for the performence of each component and establish a baseline for each. 

**Why NCERT books?**

Answers generated by RAG applications are subjective and are very hard to evaluate. Building a RAG applications without having a high quality representative question & answers dataset would make evaluating the application a daunting task.


NCERT books cover a range of topics in a very structured fasion. 
100's of Questions with expert written answers are available on the internet which we intented to use for scrutinizing the application's performence.

NCERT books complex structure incuding text, tables, images, equations, and graphs.  

We propose that a RAG application built to perform  qusetioning answering on NCERT books could be adapted on other knowledge bases.
