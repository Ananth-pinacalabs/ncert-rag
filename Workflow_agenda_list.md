1. Build a naive rag model.
2. Set up a baseline by establishing metrics of evaluation.
   1. test the embedding model.
   2. test the retrival model. 
   3. test the overall pipeline.
3. Work on incremental improvement component wise.
   1. Test optimsations on prompting.
   2. Experiment with different embedding models
   3. Experiment with chunking strategies.
   4. Experiment with retrieval.
