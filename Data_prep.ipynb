      "FOREWORD  The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the  legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF  signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these  measures  will  take  us  significantly  further  in  the  direction  of  a  child-centred  system  of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).  The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities  and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the  prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible  if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.  These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility  in  the  daily  time-table  is  as  necessary  as  rigour  in  implementing  the  annual  calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook  proves  for  making  children’s  life  at  school  a  happy  experience,  rather  than  a  source  of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden  by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance  this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.  The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard  work  done  by  the  textbook  development  committee  responsible  for  this  book.  We  wish  to  thank  the  Chairperson  of  the  advisory  group  in  science  and  mathematics, Professor  J.V.  Narlikar  and  the  Chief  Advisor  for  this  book,  Professor  K.  Muralidhar,  Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook. We are grateful to their  principals for making this possible.

      "RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOK  In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has  undertaken  the  exercise  to  rationalise  the  textbooks  across  all  classes.  Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.  Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:  • Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class  • Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject  • Difficulty level  • Content,  which  is  easily  accessible  to  students  without  much  interventions  from  teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning  • Content, which is irrelevant in the present context  This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

      "PREFACE  Biology is the study of life in its entirety. The growth of biology as a natural science during the last 1000 years is interesting from many points of view. One feature of this growth is changing emphasis. Initially it was description of life forms. Identification, nomenclature, classification of all recorded living forms enjoyed the attention of scientists for a long time. Description of their habitats and (in the case of animals) their behaviour was included in this study. In later years, the focus was physiology and internal morphology or anatomy. Darwinian ideas of evolution by natural selection changed the perception completely. Classical descriptive and clueless biology found a theoretical framework in the evolutionary theory of Darwin.  In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Physics and Chemistry were applied to Biology and the new science of Biochemistry soon became the dominant face of biology. On one hand Biochemistry was integrating with Physiology, becoming almost synonymous with it. On the other hand it gave rise to Structural Biology (structure of biomacromolecules), originally called Molecular Biology. The work of Bernal, Pauling, Watson and Crick, Hodgkins, Perutz and Kendrew, Delbruck, Luria, Monod, Beadle and Tatum, Lederberg, Brenner, Benzer, Nirenberg, Khorana, Mclintock, Sanger, Cohen, Boyer, Kornbergs (father and son), Leder, Chambon and scores of others  brought  in  and  established  a  modern  version  of  Molecular  Biology  dealing  with  life processes at molecular level.  Physics  and  Chemistry  dominated  public  perception  of  science  for  a  long  time. Daytoday life of man was influenced by developments in Physics, Chemistry and their respective manufacturing industries. Slowly and steadily, Biology, not to be left behind, demonstrated its utility for human welfare. Medical practice, especially diagnostics, green revolution and the newly emerging biotechnology and its success stories made the presence of biology felt by the common man. Patent laws brought biology into political domain and commercial value of biology became obvious.  For more than a century, classical and so-called reductionist biology fought artifical battles. The fact is both are important. Ecology brought in synthesis of both approaches and emphasised integrated understanding of biology. Form and process are both equally important. Systems biology, using mathematical tools, is bringing about a modern synthesis of both the aspects of Biology.  The Class XI and XII textbooks in biology essentially were to reflect these threads of biological thought. While the Class XI book dealt with morphology, taxonomy, molecular and cellular aspects of physiology, the Class XII book deals with the physiological process of reproduction in flowering plants and humans, the principles of inheritance, the nature of genetic  material  and  its  function,  the  contributions  of  biology  to  human  welfare,  basic principles  of  biotechnological  processes  and  their  applications  and  achievements.  The Class XII book also relates genes to evolution on one hand and presents ecological interactions, behaviour of populations and ecosystems on the other. Most important, the guidelines under NCF-2005 have been followed in letter and spirit. The total learning load has been reduced  VII  \n",

      "considerably and themes like environmental issues, adolescent problems and reproductive health have been dealt with in some detail. Studied together, the class XI and class XII textbooks in Biology would enable the student to —  (i) become familiar with the diversity of biological material. (ii)  appreciate and believe in the Darwinian evolutionary process exhibited by the living world.  (iii) understand the dynamic state of constituents of living bodies, i.e., metabolic  basis of all physiological processes in plants, animals and microbes. realise the structure and function of genetic material in directing the inherited phenotype pattern as well as a mediator of evolutionary process. appreciate the profound contributions of biology to human welfare. reflect on the physico-chemical basis of living processes and at the same time realise the limitation of reductionism in understanding behaviour of organisms. experience the humbling effect of this realisation that all living organisms are related to each other by virtue of shared genetic material. realise that biology is the story of the struggle of living organisms for existence and survival.  (iv)  (v) (vi)  (vii)  (viii)  One may notice a perceptible change in the writing style. Most of the chapters are written in an easy dialogue style engaging the student constantly while some chapters are in the form of critical comments on the subject matter. A number of questions have been provided at the end of each chapter though answers to some may not be found in the text. Students have to read supplementary material, upon advise from the teacher, to answer such questions. I am thankful to Professor Krishna Kumar, Director NCERT; Professor G. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT and Professor Hukum Singh, Head, DESM, NCERT for constant support. I must place on record my deep appreciation for Dr B.K. Tripathi, Reader, DESM, NCERT for his  relentless  efforts  as  coordinator  in  bringing  out  the  Biology  textbook  for  both  the Class XI and XII. All the members of the development team, the experts and reviewers, and the school teachers have contributed enormously in the preparation of this book. I thank them all. I am indeed highly thankful to the members of monitoring committee constituted by Ministry of Human Resource Development for their valuable observation that helped in the improvement of the book at the final stage. The book is prepared keeping in mind the guidelines of the NCF-2005 especially the emphasis on reducing the learning load. We hope that the book would meet the expectations of all the stakeholders.
